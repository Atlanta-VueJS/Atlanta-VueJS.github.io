# Atlanta Vue.js Meetup Group

## What We're About

The Atlanta Vue.js Meetup is a meetup for anyone interested in the progressive JavaScript 
framework Vue.js. Described by many to be a mix between AngularJS and React, Vue.js is easily 
approachable, versatile, and performance focused. Potential discussion topics include the growing 
Vue Ecosystem, development patterns, and real world use cases of the framework.

Meeting are held on a monthly basis, and food will be provided. After a presentation of the 
topic of choice, there will be time for a Q & A session, followed by some time for smaller 
networking and discussions.
